# My Keyboard Setup

The goal of my keyboard setup is to minimize the use of the mouse. 

Here are the apps I use:
-

**Karabiner Elements**: Remap keys and add hotkeys, allowing me to add an additional layer making shortcuts easier.

**Shortcat**: Allows me to type to navigate my mouse. I use a ```hyper``` key (created with Karabiner Elements) and ```r``` to activate Shortcat.

**Amethyst**: Window Tile Manager allows me to easily switch between applications/monitors and resize windows.

Features:
-
#### Remapped Caps Lock to a ```hyper``` key using Karabiner Elements:
 - Single tap ```hyper``` key for backspace.
 - ```hyper``` key and:
   - Use ```j``` / ```k``` / ```i``` / ```l``` for left/down/up/right respectively.
   - Use ```g``` for left click.

#### Shifting by words:
Added the ability to easily navigate text by remapping the left shift and right shift keys to move by a single word in the left and right directions, respectively. Holding down the shift key will still perform its default function, but a single tap will move the caret one word to the left or right.

#### ```[``` Launcher:
The goal of the launcher is to quickly open up applications by simultaneously clicking the ```[``` key and another key that represents the application.


Other apps:
-
I use the ```hyper``` key with both Shortcat and Amethyst.

- For Shortcat, I use ```hyper``` and ```r``` to activate the search.
- For Amethyst, I use ```hyper``` and:
  - ```a``` for Move focus to clockwise screen (swap between monitors).
  - ```s``` for Move focus counterclockwise (swap between windows on the same monitor).
  - ```d``` for Move focus clockwise (swap between windows on the same monitor).
  - ```f``` for Move focus to counterclockwise screen (swap between monitors).

  - ```z``` for Swap focused window to counterclockwise screen (move window to a different monitor).
  - ```x``` for Swap focused window clockwise (move windows on the same monitor).
  - ```c``` for Swap focused window counterclockwise (move windows on the same monitor).
  - ```v``` for Swap focused window to clockwise screen (move window to a different monitor).

  - ```enter``` for Cycle layout forward (used to switch between fullscreen and side-by-side windows).
  - ```-``` for Shrink main pane (decrease size of window, increasing the other window).
  - ```=``` for Expand main pane (increase size of window, decreasing the other window).
